# Cookbook

Build real things, fast. Each recipe is a complete, working starting point —
the YAML config, the Python script, and how to test it — for a common SIP role.
They're deliberately small (usually under 60 lines of Python) so you can read the
whole thing and adapt it.

Every recipe is grounded in a real script in the repo (linked at the bottom of each
page); none of the APIs here are invented.

## The recipes

| Recipe | What you build | Key ideas |
|---|---|---|
| [Registrar](registrar.md) | A SIP registrar with digest auth | `auth.require_digest`, `registrar.save`/`lookup`, NAT fixups |
| [Stateful proxy](proxy.md) | A residential/edge proxy | `request.fork`, `loose_route`, `record_route`, sanity checks |
| [Load balancer](load-balancer.md) | A front LB over a backend pool | `gateway.select`, health probing, subscriber affinity |
| [Least-Cost Routing](least-cost-routing.md) | Carrier LCR driven by an external API | `lcr.route`, `call.route` sequential failover, gateway pools, CDR |
| [SBC (B2BUA)](sbc.md) | A topology-hiding SBC with media | `@b2bua.*`, `call.dial`/`fork`, **header policies**, RTPEngine |
| [Number normalization](number-normalization.md) | E.164 identity rewriting at a trunk↔IMS edge | `numbers.parse`, `rewrite_identities`, **number policies**, diversion family |
| [Media & RTP profiles](media-rtp.md) | SRTP↔RTP, WebRTC, transcoding, hold | `rtpengine.offer`/`answer`, profiles, the `sdp` namespace |
| [Online charging (OCS)](online-charging-ocs.md) | Prepaid voice + SMS/RCS over Diameter Ro | `ro:` config, `diameter.ro_ccr_*`, SCUR reserve/re-auth/disconnect, IEC, CGRateS |
| [Hardening & security](security.md) | A locked-down edge | rate-limit, scanner/auth bans, TLS/mTLS, STIR/SHAKEN, IPsec |
| [Monitoring & observability](monitoring.md) | Metrics, CDRs, tracing, probes | custom Prometheus metrics, `/admin/*`, CDR, HEP/Homer |
| [Multi-file scripts](multi-file-scripts.md) | Splitting a script into helper modules | sibling `import`, `include_paths`, helper hot-reload |

## How to run any recipe

Each recipe is a `siphon.yaml` + a Python script. Point the config at the script and
run siphon:

```yaml
# siphon.yaml
script:
  path: "/etc/siphon/myscript.py"
```

```bash
siphon --config /etc/siphon/siphon.yaml
```

Scripts **hot-reload** — edit and save, no restart (except `listen:` changes). Test
your script logic without a running server using the
[`siphon-sip` mock SDK](https://github.com/siphon-project/siphon-sip/tree/main/sdk).

## Mixing roles

A single script can be several of these at once — the dispatcher routes INVITEs to
your `@b2bua.on_invite` handler and everything else to `@proxy.on_request`. So a
"proxy for REGISTER/OPTIONS + SBC for calls" is one script, one process (see the
[SBC recipe](sbc.md) and the README's hybrid-mode section).

For running more than one node, see [Scaling & redundancy](../scaling-and-redundancy.md)
and [Deployment & operations](../deployment.md).
