# Call

The `Call` object drives a back-to-back user agent (B2BUA). Unlike the proxy
`Request`, a `Call` owns both legs — it can dial, fork, bridge, rewrite either
leg's URIs, and anchor media. It is passed to the `@b2bua.*` handlers.

```python
from siphon import b2bua

@b2bua.on_invite
async def bridge(call):
    call.dial(call.ruri)
```

::: siphon_sdk.call.Call

## `MediaHandle`

Returned by `call.media` — controls RTP anchoring for the call.

::: siphon_sdk.types.MediaHandle

## `ByeInitiator`

Identifies which side ended an answered call (surfaced on `@b2bua.on_bye`).

::: siphon_sdk.types.ByeInitiator
