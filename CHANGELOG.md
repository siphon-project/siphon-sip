# Changelog

All notable changes to SIPhon are documented here. The format loosely follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/). Versioning is lockstep across
the `siphon-sip` crate and the `siphon-sip` Python SDK, driven by the git tag.

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **Generic Diameter server mode** — the Diameter stack was client-only
  (originate toward HSS/PCRF); it now also accepts inbound Diameter from
  authenticated peers, runs the CER/CEA handshake and the DWR/DWA watchdog, and
  dispatches each inbound request to Python. Transport direction is independent
  of request direction (RFC 6733 §2.1): incoming **and** outgoing connections,
  TCP + SCTP, and a node that dials out (`diameter.connect_to`) can still serve
  inbound requests over that connection. New Python server API:
  `@diameter.on_inbound_cer` (advertise CEA identity), `@diameter.on_request`
  with optional `"App:CMD"` filter (`req.answer(code)` / `req.reject(code)` /
  `await req.forward_to(peer)`; unhandled → `3002`), `@diameter.on_reply`
  (central answer-AVP rewrite — topology hiding, Origin / Result-Code mapping),
  `@diameter.on_request_completed` (post-answer event hook), and
  `diameter.peer_pool(target)` (round-robin / weighted / sticky with
  Route-Record loop detection → `3005` and per-call timeout). Two Rust-only
  admission gates run before any Python: source-IP CIDR ACL + Origin-Host
  validation. A lossless AVP tree (`DiameterMsg` / `Avp`) sits alongside the
  JSON decode path for byte-faithful relay that preserves unknown AVPs and flags
  verbatim. Config is flat single-domain
  (`diameter.{listen, origin_host, clients, servers, connect_to}`) or an
  explicit per-domain map; `diameter.event_sink` writes per-transaction events
  (file / none; clickhouse / kafka feature-gated). Ships an **S6a dictionary**
  (TS 29.272: command codes 316–324, AVPs 1400–1450 / 1635, AIR / ULR / PUR
  builders + parsers) and examples (`examples/diameter_server.{py,yaml}`,
  `examples/hss_s6a.py`).
- **glibc allocator instrumentation** — new `siphon_glibc_*` Prometheus gauges
  (`system_bytes`, `in_use_bytes`, `free_bytes`, `mmap_bytes`, `arena_count`)
  sourced from `malloc_info(3)`, aggregated across all arenas. This surfaces the
  C-side / CPython-raw-domain memory pool (incl. `libsctp`) that jemalloc
  (`siphon_memory_*`) and CPython's mimalloc (`siphon_python_allocated_blocks`)
  cannot see; because Rust runs on jemalloc, glibc's arenas hold only the C
  side, so the gauges isolate it cleanly. Deliberately uses `malloc_info` rather
  than `mallinfo2`, which reports the main arena only. Sampled on the dispatcher
  cleanup tick; no-op off glibc. `SIGUSR2` dumps the full `malloc_info` XML to
  the log for call-site attribution.
- **`memory:` config block** for allocator runtime tuning:
  `memory.glibc.arena_max` (`mallopt(M_ARENA_MAX)`, caps the number of arenas)
  and `memory.glibc.trim_interval_secs` (periodic `malloc_trim(0)`). The gauges
  above are always-on; both knobs default off — measure first, bound only if the
  pool proves to be arena retention rather than a leak.
- **`siphon_sbi_npcf_app_sessions_active` gauge** — active N5/Npcf app-sessions
  created by this NF and not yet deleted (a steady climb under flat call rate is
  a stranded-session leak), backed by a new per-replica app-session registry on
  `NpcfClient` that inserts on create and removes on delete.

### Changed
- **SCTP is now an opt-in build feature, off by default.** SIP-over-SCTP
  (RFC 4168) and Diameter-over-SCTP link the `libsctp` system library, which
  only exists on Linux. Moving them behind the `sctp` Cargo feature lets the
  default build — including the official Docker image and the prebuilt release
  packages (`.deb` / `.rpm` / tarball) — drop the `libsctp-dev` / `libsctp1`
  dependency and build cleanly on macOS and Windows.
  - **To enable SCTP:** build with `--features sctp` (on Linux, install
    `libsctp-dev` first). The official Docker image and release binaries do
    **not** include SCTP — you must build it yourself.
  - **No config or scripting-API breakage:** the `Transport::Sctp` variant and
    the `listen.sctp` config block still exist, so existing configs parse
    unchanged whether or not the feature is enabled.
  - **When built without SCTP:** a configured `listen.sctp` listener is skipped
    with a warning, and a Diameter peer set to `transport: sctp` fails at
    connect with `ErrorKind::Unsupported` (no silent fallback to TCP).
  - CI builds and tests both configurations (default and `--features sctp`).

### Performance
- `SipHeaders` now stores one `IndexMap<String, (String, Vec<String>)>` (lowercase
  key → original-cased name + values) instead of two parallel maps. This removes a
  per-header key-clone + hash-insert on the parse path, halves the copy-on-write
  clone, and serializes in a single pass. Criterion microbenches: SIP parse −30%,
  serialize −50%, full parse→serialize roundtrip −33%, first header write −20%.
  No public API change; serialized output is byte-identical (RFC 4475 + proptest
  roundtrips unchanged).

### Internal
- Per-module steady-state memory-leak guards for the control-plane paths the
  SIP mem-leak test never exercised, each gating on the production store
  draining back to baseline: rtpengine (`pending` correlation map on the success
  and timeout paths), diameter (`pending` map through the real connection
  reader, sequential and under concurrent in-flight load), and SBI/N5
  (`NpcfClient` app-session store across create → delete).
- Criterion microbenchmarks for the per-message / per-call hot paths, one bench
  file per path: `sip_hot_path` (parse/serialize/header/txn-key), `sdp_hot_path`
  (parse/filter/serialize), `diameter_codec` (AVP encode + message decode),
  `rtpengine_bencode` (NG offer encode/decode), and `crypto` (Milenage AKA +
  digest response assembly). They isolate the individual costs the SIPp
  throughput baseline averages over.
- Release-cut regression gate (`scripts/bench_regression.sh`, wired into
  `scripts/cut-release.sh`): fails on >10% slowdown vs the committed
  `benches/baseline.json`. Self-contained (reads criterion's own `estimates.json`,
  no `critcmp`/`jq`). CI proves the benches compile; the hard timing gate runs at
  release cut on fixed hardware, where absolute timings are meaningful.

## [1.0.0] — 2026-06-26

First stable release. A love letter to Kamailio and OpenSIPS — their proven
architecture, rebuilt with a Rust core and free-threaded Python 3.14t scripting.
The developer writes business logic; SIPhon owns the protocol.

### Core
- RFC 3261 SIP parser (RFC 4475 torture tests, proptest roundtrips, fuzzing)
- Stateful proxy (§16) with parallel/sequential forking (§16.7)
- Transaction state machines (§17), dialog tracking, Record-Route / loose routing
- First-class, scriptable B2BUA (§6) — proxy and B2BUA in a single binary

### Transports
- UDP, TCP, TLS 1.3, WebSocket (WS/WSS), SCTP
- NAT traversal (rport, RFC 3581), Outbound / flow tokens (RFC 5626)

### Registrar & auth
- AoR store with memory / Redis / PostgreSQL backends, GRUU, Service-Route
- Digest auth (RFC 2617 / 7616) with timestamp-bound nonces and AoR-to-user binding
- AKAv1-MD5 / Milenage (RFC 3310, 3GPP TS 33.203 / 35.206)

### IMS & 5G
- Diameter Cx / Rx / Ro / Rf / Sh; Initial Filter Criteria (iFC) with ISC routing
- IPsec SA management for P-CSCF; 5G SBI Npcf (N5) + Nbsf PCF discovery
- Runnable P-CSCF / I-CSCF / S-CSCF examples

### Media & routing
- RTPEngine NG media anchoring, SDP codec filtering, media injection
- Gateway load balancing with health probing, DNS SRV/NAPTR (RFC 3263), ENUM
- Presence (SUBSCRIBE/NOTIFY, PIDF, RLS), outbound REGISTER

### Observability & compliance
- Prometheus metrics (built-in + custom), HEP/Homer tracing, CDR, admin HTTP API
- Lawful Intercept (ETSI X1/X2/X3) + SIPREC (RFC 7865 / 7866), graceful shutdown

### Scripting
- Free-threaded Python 3.14t (no GIL), hot-reload, sync + async handlers
- `siphon-sip` mock SDK on PyPI for unit-testing scripts (imported as `siphon_sdk`)

### Performance
- Design targets — Proxy 10k cps, B2BUA 5k cps (8-core). Stays clean past
  31.9k cps on the reference box with zero failures and zero retransmits across
  all 16 baseline rows.
